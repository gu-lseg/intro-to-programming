Data Structures
***************

Data structures are objects that contain other objects.
We will look at two: `lists`, `dictionaries`.

Typical methods defined on data structures allow access to the items within
so that they can be read and updated.

As always, first we will explore how to create objects using literals and
constructors, we will then examine some typical methods of each object.

Second, we often want to do something for each item in a data structure. This
involves 'iterating' over it. We do this using the for loop.


Lists
=====

A list object contains ordered items.

Creation
--------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ['John', 'Eric', 'Michael', 'Terry']          # literal
    >>> list('abc')                                   # `list` transform a string
    ['a', 'b', 'c']
    >>> type([1, 2, 3])
    <class 'list'>


Extraction & Update
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> abc = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    >>> abc[0]                        # extract item
    'a'
    >>> abc[2] = 'd'                  # update item
    >>> abc
    ['a', 'b', 'd']


.. tip::
    The 'index' of an item refers to its position in the list.
    Lists are 0 indexed; the first item is at index 0, the second at 1...

If you ask for an item that is outside of the list's length you will get an `IndexError`.


range
-----

The `range` function combined with the `list` constructor is a quick way of creating a list
with a specified number of increasing integers.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> list(range(3))   # think: give me numbers up to 3
    [0, 1, 2]


It provides a convenient shortcut to do things a certain number of times.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for i in range(2):
    ...    print('hi')
    'hi'
    'hi'


Dictionaries
============

Dictionaries are made up of key-value mappings; given a `key`, we get
access to the `value` associated with that `key`.

They can be used to collect information (data) about something.
Here we use a dictionary to represent a Person.

creation
--------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M'}              # literal
    >>> dict([('name', 'Brian'), ('age', 23), ('sex', 'M')])  # constructor


extraction & update
-------------------

Special syntax: `<dict-name>[<key>]` for extracting and updating an attribute.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> person = {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M'}
    >>> person['name']                          # extract value
    'Brian'
    >>> person['name'] = 'Naomi'                # update value
    >>> person['name']
    'Name'

If you request a non-existent key you get a `KeyError`.


Nesting
=======

Data structures can include any type of object including other data structures.

Here is a list of dictionaries:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> persons = [
            {'name': 'Naomi', 'age': 32, 'sex': 'F', 'status': 'Single'},
            {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 29, 'sex': 'F', 'status': 'Married'},
            {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M', 'status': 'Single'}
        ]

Nested data structures are extremely common.

Think how this could be used to, for example, store information about all
students in a class.


The `for` loop
==============

Use `for` to iterate over each item in a given list.

Here by iterating through a list of `str` objects we change the colour of our
turtle alex.

.. code-block:: python

    from turtle import Turtle, exitonclick

    alex = Turtle()

    for a_colour in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
       alex.color(a_colour)
       alex.forward(50)
       alex.left(90)

    exitonclick()


Refactoring `square`
--------------------

We can refactor `square` by combining `range` with a `for` loop.

.. code-block:: python

    def square(side):
        for i in range(4):
            turtle.forward(side)
            turtle.left(90)

Drawing a square is reduced to repeating the same action four times.

Thanks to the `for` loop our definition of a square in code:

* is shorter and more readable.
* communicates an insight into the geometry of a square.


Exercises
=========


Refactor `shapes.py`
--------------------

Refactor all the shapes in `shapes.py` and make good use of loops where you
can.

Hexagon
-------

Write code that draws this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-hexagon.png


Honeycomb
---------

Write code that draws this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-honeycomb.png


Any Shape
---------

Write code that can draw any shape like this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-all-shapes.png

.. tip::

    The sum of the external angles of any shape is always 360 degrees.


Practical: Paper Scissors Rock
-----------------------------

Steps:

1. The user inputs either 'paper', 'scissors' or 'rock'.
2. The computer randomly chooses one too.
3. The outcome is printed, according to the rules of the game:

   * If the user chooses 'paper' and the computer chooses 'rock', then print 'rock wins'
   * if the user chooses 'scissors' and the computer chooses 'paper' then print 'scissors wins'
   * ... and so on ...
4. Exit

You will need to use some randomness:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import random
    >>> random.choice(['a', 'b', 'c'])

Looping `turtles`
-----------------

Using the following as template draw this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-queue.png

Put the following in a file called `turtle_queue.py` and finish off the
program.

.. code-block:: python

    import turtle

    number_of_turtles = 4

    turtles = []
    for _ in range(number_of_turtles):
        turtles.append(turtle.Turtle())

    # position point of origin at bottom left of window
    turtle.setworldcoordinates(0, 0, 600, 600)

    for i, turtle_ in enumerate(turtles):
        turtle_.up()

    # Evenly space out the turtles
    for i, turtle_ in enumerate(turtles):
        ypos = 600 / number_of_turtles * i
        turtle_.setpos(0, ypos)

    for i, turtle_ in enumerate(turtles):
        turtle_.down()
